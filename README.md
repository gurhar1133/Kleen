# Kleen
- Based on the circut modeling project from runestone's adaptation of Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python
By Brad Miller and David Ranum, Luther College. logicClass.py has minimal modifications to the original project from the book and contains 
the LogicGate parent class as well as logic gate class definitions based on traditional binary logic. 

- kleen_logic.py introduces trinary logic gates and has a main function that walks the user through some implications of trinary logic
values. Such non-traditional logics have been devised by philosophers. One such example is Kleen's K3 logic
(see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic)

Objective:
The main purpose of this project is to get a better grasp on object oriented programming in general by modeling
something that interests me with it. Setting up user defined classes, methods and inheritance schemes helped
me get a better understanding of how OOP works.
